# Summary for week 6

## Dario

This Week I refactored the Book database interface to enable implementing the Sale database efficiently, I implemented the getAll() method for the FirebaseBookDatabase when searching by ISBN, finishing the rest should be rather quick. I also spent a couple of hours trying to debug a bug in Raoul's activity involving the OpenLibrary Database. I did not succeed. This bug is quantum. I also reviewed a few PRs. I had to precise my task a little because I wouldn't have been able to finish the entire FirebaseBookDatabase, next week I will create smaller tasks.

This week I was able to refactor bit of code and start the nav bar, which turned out to be simpler than I though.

Next week I hope I'll be able to discover what the GPS will require.

## Raoul

This week, I got stuck several hours trying to debug the relationship between my FillSaleActivity and the OpenLibraryDatabase, to no avail. After already spending more than my "remaining expected" time on this, I decided to switch to attend my other task of taking book pictures. There, I could lay down the groundwork, but as I did not had my full 4 hours left to work on it and had to switch to using Fragments, I couldn't finish it. I also spent some time reviewing PRs. 
My time-estimates were obviously off, but I don't feel like I could have foreseen spending so much time on a bug.

Next week, I will probably again focus on those two tasks as I don't think it would be too wise to take on a 3rd task, nor leave those 2 unfinished.

## Zied (Scrum Master)

This week I cleaned the User profile page and cleaned some other code that I did. 
I also finished to implement the registration and login by email/password but still have to create tests for it.
The implementation of registration and login by email/password should have been scheduled for 2 weeks for it to be perfectly implemented (with the tests etc...)
So Next week, If I am taking a task that seems too big, I will break it into smaller tasks.
