# Summary for week 6

## Dario

This Week I refactored the Book database interface to enable implementing the Sale database efficiently, I implemented the getAll() method for the FirebaseBookDatabase when searching by ISBN, finishing the rest should be rather quick. I also spent a couple of hours trying to debug a bug in Raoul's activity involving the OpenLibrary Database. I did not succeed. This bug is quantum. I also reviewed a few PRs. I had to precise my task a little because I wouldn't have been able to finish the entire FirebaseBookDatabase, next week I will create smaller tasks.

This week I was able to refactor bit of code and start the nav bar, which turned out to be simpler than I though.

Next week I hope I'll be able to discover what the GPS will require.
