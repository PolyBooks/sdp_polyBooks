# Summary for week 6

## Dario

This Week I refactored the Book database interface to enable implementing the Sale database efficiently, I implemented the getAll() method for the FirebaseBookDatabase when searching by ISBN, finishing the rest should be rather quick. I also spent a couple of hours trying to debug a bug in Raoul's activity involving the OpenLibrary Database. I did not succeed. This bug is quantum. I also reviewed a few PRs. I had to precise my task a little because I wouldn't have been able to finish the entire FirebaseBookDatabase, next week I will create smaller tasks.

## Joshua

This week I was able to refactor bit of code and start the nav bar, which turned out to be simpler than I though.

Next week I hope I'll be able to discover what the GPS will require.

## Nicolas (Scrum Master)

This week I focused on finishing the sale UI display (show all the books that correspond to a particular request) as well as helping my teammates on brainstorming how to implement a particular feature.

Next week I'll try to take a little bit more work, because as said last weekly meeting, I expected my work to not take the full 8h of work.

## Raoul

This week, I got stuck several hours trying to debug the relationship between my FillSaleActivity and the OpenLibraryDatabase, to no avail. After already spending more than my "remaining expected" time on this, I decided to switch to attend my other task of taking book pictures. There, I could lay down the groundwork, but as I did not had my full 4 hours left to work on it and had to switch to using Fragments, I couldn't finish it. I also spent some time reviewing PRs.
My time-estimates were obviously off, but I don't feel like I could have foreseen spending so much time on a bug.

Next week, I will probably again focus on those two tasks as I don't think it would be too wise to take on a 3rd task, nor leave those 2 unfinished.

## Sophie

I wasn't able to finish all my tasks, I really underestimated the time to make the filtering dynamic. I fixed the `Serializable` issue and added functions in the the Interests database to provide list of existing interests parameters.
I was only able to make the display of `SortBy` parameter dynamic for the FilteringSales activity. I hope to be able to finish this task by the end of next sprint.

## Zied

This week I cleaned the User profile page and cleaned some other code that I did.
I also finished to implement the registration and login by email/password but still have to create tests for it.
The implementation of registration and login by email/password should have been scheduled for 2 weeks for it to be perfectly implemented (with the tests etc...)
So Next week, If I am taking a task that seems too big, I will break it into smaller tasks.

## Overall team

Overall, this week we made progress on different fronts ranging from login/sale display/firebase revamp/sale filtering. We also defined a set of coding guidelines that we are now all using in order to unify the project. Our two meetings were fruitful: we had a short but concise meeting on Tuesday and decided of our coding guidelines on Thursday.
