# Summary for week 10

## Dario
This Week I implemented a Book Cache. This required some refactoring for it not to be a big pile of spaghetti and to pass a Context to the databases.
I spent more time than the 8h we should work for this week, but that feature is important, and people haven't even started reviewing it. for next time I should try to make smaller PRs to not frighten the others.

This week, I feel like I wasted too much time debugging consequences of the fact I previously implemented build-variants and source-sets. While I still think build-variants and source-sets is the most professional way to handle mocking for instance, in the context of this project, it lead me to slightly regretting doing it as it added complications close to the end of the project and there were maybe easier way to mock the DBs. Anyways, I was still able to finish merging one of my attributed task, but not the 2 others.
For next time, I will fully finish those two tasks, and put in overtime as needed to clean up and debug the project as a whole.
