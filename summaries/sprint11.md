# Summary for week 10

## Dario
This Week I implemented a Book Cache. This required some refactoring for it not to be a big pile of spaghetti and to pass a Context to the databases.
I spent more time than the 8h we should work for this week, but that feature is important, and people haven't even started reviewing it. for next time I should try to make smaller PRs to not frighten the others.

## Joshua
This week I did several tasks, including UI which I've become more familiar with and add tests which took more time then ex√®ected, and I had to find some information on how to bo something before the rule, which wasn't easy to find. I also ended up helping Zied and Raoul with some bugs they had.
For next time I hope to clean up the project.

## Nicolas

This week, we all spent a lot of time trying to resolve archaic issues we never had to solve. I finished the "retract a sale" feature as well as start the "edit a sale" feature. It might not seem much, but I had a lot of trouble merging/accomodating the work with what's already written

For next week, I hope to have a clean working project! :)


## Raoul
This week, I feel like I wasted too much time debugging consequences of the fact I previously implemented build-variants and source-sets. While I still think build-variants and source-sets is the most professional way to handle mocking for instance, in the context of this project, it lead me to slightly regretting doing it as it added complications close to the end of the project and there were maybe easier way to mock the DBs. Anyways, I was still able to finish merging one of my attributed task, but not the 2 others.
For next time, I will fully finish those two tasks, and put in overtime as needed to clean up and debug the project as a whole.


## Sophie


## Zied (Scrum Master)

This week I finished the implementation of the real time geo-localisation between users. 
Now users can locate each other to buy books.


## Overall team

This week we focused on the cache and GPS feature and some other little options. 
We have a lot of pull requests to merge that still has to be organized.
