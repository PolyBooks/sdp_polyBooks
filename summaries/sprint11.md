# Summary for week 10

## Dario
This Week I implemented a Book Cache. This required some refactoring for it not to be a big pile of spaghetti and to pass a Context to the databases.
I spent more time than the 8h we should work for this week, but that feature is important, and people haven't even started reviewing it. for next time I should try to make smaller PRs to not frighten the others.
