## Raoul
This week, I finished the logic of last sprint task. As I couldn't run the Activity without the implementation of BookDatabase which was just merged very recently, I couldn't run the emulator and as such, still need to write tests. So while waiting, I already started to work on this sprint task, but couldn't finish it for obvious time reasons. I also spent about 2h reviewing PRs.

Next week, I think I'll bundle up both tasks at once.

## Sophie

I was not able to implement my tasks of the week. I spent time correcting the issues/comments emitted on my pull request and added some more tests to the existing code. I also reviewed myself a few pull requests. Finally, issues happened after merging the implementation of some classes with the main branch and I am currently correcting that with help of Dario.

## Zied (Scrum Master)

This week I implemented de user profile page from which we can use there informations to increase the user experience on PolyBooks. I also wanted to implement the registration/login by email and password but because of health issues I didn't have time.

## Overall team

Overall, this week, we talked a lot on how to organize the database to best fit the service proposed by Polybooks.
