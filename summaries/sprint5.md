# Summary for week 5

## Dario

This week I finally got to merge the OpenLibrary database, and started extending it with firebase.
I hope I will have more progress next week

---
## Joshua

This week I wrapped up sale filters and helped Raoul by implementing two functions
I was able to review more PR this week

Next week I hope to be able to do something a bit different

## Nicolas

This week I started working on the UI (show all active sales that correspond to a request) for the first time. This is not finished yet, but it's starting to look good. The tests are lagging behind (ie. minimal for now)

Next week, I'll want to finish this task to get a little more experience with UI. I might also be able to take another task

## Raoul
This week, I finished the logic of last sprint task. As I couldn't run the Activity without the implementation of BookDatabase which was just merged very recently, I couldn't run the emulator and as such, still need to write tests. So while waiting, I already started to work on this sprint task, but couldn't finish it for obvious time reasons. I also spent about 2h reviewing PRs.

Next week, I think I'll bundle up both tasks at once.

## Sophie

I was not able to implement my tasks of the week. I spent time correcting the issues/comments emitted on my pull request and added some more tests to the existing code. I also reviewed myself a few pull requests. Finally, issues happened after merging the implementation of some classes with the main branch and I am currently correcting that with help of Dario.
