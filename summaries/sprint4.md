# Summary for week 4

This week I started out by fixing the tests, which allowed our test coverage to nearly double. Then I went and built on Sophie. I'm happy to make pieces work together.
Communication was better than last week I think.

Next week I hope to get the maintainability under control, even if I'm not sure this is possible.

## Raoul
I only worked 2h on my attributed task so couldn't finish it. The rest of my 8h were actually divided between trying to write tests for the parts using the MLKit and the camera (a mistake, but they amounted to a good amount of lines of codes, so we thought it was worth trying), installing the 2.7 inches emulator (and checking that layouts were alright on it), and a meeting between most members of our team about the UX flow and the UI.

I guess next week I should focus more on my official tasks, but the pressure put on our test-coverage still lead me to try to test the camera and the ML library, so I feel it was kind of justified. And I also don't think we should sacrifice UX/UI conversations just because we can't place them on the sprint board.

## Sophie (Scrum Master)
I adapted the layouts of my Activities, so that it adapts to the cirrus emulator screen, and I took the occasion to make the views more scalable (adding different scrolling views). I also wrote tests for the two filtering activities. The overall work was much more than 8 hours, but at least I was able to finish my task. There is just a minor fix that I need to do before merging to the main branch today and moving to the next task, which is loading the filtering parameters and display dynamically the two filtering activities.

## Overall team
This week the whole team focused on improving the test coverage. This was more difficult for some of us because their implementation use external libraries and frameworks that are very difficult to test. As the weeks pass, we will probably get a better sense of what is "testable" and how to test efficiently our code. We also did our two weekly meetings plus one long meeting to discuss of the user experience and the architecture of the UI and one meeting with the epfl's library to see if we can work with their API to query for the books in epfl.
