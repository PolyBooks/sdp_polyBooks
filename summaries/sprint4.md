# Summary for week 3

## Dario

## Joshua

This week I started out by fixing the tests, which allowed our test coverage to nearly double. Then I went and built on Sophie. I'm happy to make pieces work together.
Communication was better than last week I think.

Next week I hope to get the maintainability under control, even if I'm not sure this is possible.
