I only worked 2h on my attributed task so couldn't finish it. The rest of my 8h were actually divided between trying to write tests for the parts using the MLKit and the camera (a mistake, but they amounted to a good amount of lines of codes, so we thought it was worth trying), installing the 2.7 inches emulator (and checking that layouts were alright on it), and a meeting between most members of our team about the UX flow and the UI.

I guess next week I should focus more on my official tasks, but the pressure put on our test-coverage still lead me to try to test the camera and the ML library, so I feel it was kind of justified. And I also don't think we should sacrifice UX/UI conversations just because we can't place them on the sprint board.
