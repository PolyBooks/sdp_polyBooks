# Summary for week 9

## Dario


## Joshua (Scrum Master)
This week I was busy introducing an activity, and refactoring what had been done. I think putting a bit more thought into what I could write would prevent some mistakes.

Next time I hope that the user will be fully operational

## Raoul



## Sophie


## Zied



## Overall team

I think we are getting smoother and smoother at using github. Time estimation could be better
