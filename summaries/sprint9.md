# Summary for week 9

## Dario


## Joshua (Scrum Master)
This week I was busy introducing an activity, and refactoring what had been done. I think putting a bit more thought into what I could write would prevent some mistakes.

Next time I hope that the user will be fully operational

## Raoul
This week, I spent some unforeseen time on major refactorings, part some stuff I wanted to do for a while, and part thanks to the helpful code review the TA gave us. While I didn't add crucial new features, I feel satisfied with my work, both on convenience refactors and changing the databases to singleton objects as I think it will streamline the codebase for the end of the project. On top of that, as usual I did some PR review and corrected requested changes on my PRs.

## Overall team

I think we are getting smoother and smoother at using github. Time estimation could be better
