# Summary for week 9

## Dario
This week I started by accomplishing two tasks I gave myself in one hour each as planned. Later I spent three hours trying to create a mock OpenLibrary database that would work on the emulator, I was not successful and gave up. I also spent a few hours exploring the possibilities for fetching the price of books from somewhere on the internet. Ebay's API might be the easiest. I also reviewed a few PRs.

I was able to work very efficiently at the start of the week, I hope to be able to reproduce this next week.

## Joshua (Scrum Master)
This week I was busy introducing an activity, and refactoring what had been done. I think putting a bit more thought into what I could write would prevent some mistakes.

Next time I hope that the user will be fully operational

## Raoul
This week, I spent some unforeseen time on major refactorings, part some stuff I wanted to do for a while, and part thanks to the helpful code review the TA gave us. While I didn't add crucial new features, I feel satisfied with my work, both on convenience refactors and changing the databases to singleton objects as I think it will streamline the codebase for the end of the project. On top of that, as usual I did some PR review and corrected requested changes on my PRs.


## Sophie
This week I explored how to implement the chat feature, and I began with the implementation of the chat activity, without bothering yet with linking it to the users and firebase. Next week I will try to have a functional chat, and the week after I will plug it to firebase.

## Overall team

I think we are getting smoother and smoother at using github. Time estimation could be better
