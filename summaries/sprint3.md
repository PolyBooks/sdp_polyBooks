I think my time estimates are pretty accurate, however I couldn't finish everything because 1) I attributed myself 3 tasks for a total of 9h instead of 8h, and 2) because of other deadlines, I could only afford to work 6h30 on SDP this week. 

I still could PR'ed all my work as my biggest task could easily be split into two subtasks (UI, xml, layout vs feature, database, Kotlin) and the 2 others are done.
