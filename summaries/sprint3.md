# Summary for week 3

## Joshua (Scrum Master)

I helped Nicolas a bit with connecting to the database before going on to try to create tests for the main activity. There I encountered problems that ate up the rest of my time

Next time I hope to be able to find a solution to this problem.

I think my time estimates are pretty accurate, however I couldn't finish everything because 1) I attributed myself 3 tasks for a total of 9h instead of 8h, and 2) because of other deadlines, I could only afford to work 6h30 on SDP this week.

I still could PR'ed all my work as my biggest task could easily be split into two subtasks (UI, xml, layout vs feature, database, Kotlin) and the 2 others are done.

My task this week was to complete the sorting and filtering mechanism and ui for the books, which I did five hours (so for a total of approximately 12 hours, if it is added to the work of last week). However, to have a good way to test the database, the same mechanism was needed for the sales, which also took me approximately five hours. I thus didn't have the time to implement the tests for my implementation, and I didn't do a pull request for my work.

I am encountering an issue that we are trying to solve with the team : when the filtering parameters are set and the `Result` button is pressed, we need to launch the activity to actually list the books/sales. The fact of adding an extra parameter (the Query) makes the program crash.

For next week, I need to 1. Fix this issue 2. implement the tests for the two activities (Books and Sales filtering) if I have the time, I will help Joshua with his own tests

## Overall team

This week was rough with several people encountering roadblocks, but interactions in the team remain good. Several PR that are in the works should be able to get finished up. get finished up
Next week I hope we can resolve these test issues that can end up being a real dealbreaker for the app.
