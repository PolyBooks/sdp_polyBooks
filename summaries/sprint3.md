# Summary for week 3

## Dario
I think that my time estimate this week was accurate. I implemented the Open library Book database, wrote tests for it. I also discussed about the API/interface with Josh and updated the interface for interests accordingly. I also reviewed some pull requests. So all in all, I should continue like that, and maybe become a bit more efficient.

## Joshua (Scrum Master)

I helped Nicolas a bit with connecting to the database before going on to try to create tests for the main activity. There I encountered problems that ate up the rest of my time

Next time I hope to be able to find a solution to this problem.

## Nicolas

To compensate for last week, I worked more than 8 hours during this week. We met together to discuss the implementation of our various (3) database interface implementations. I implemented the sale related one dealing with `Task` to `CompletableFuture` conversion. I finished by writing some tests to test the whole interface

## Raoul

I think my time estimates are pretty accurate, however I couldn't finish everything because 1) I attributed myself 3 tasks for a total of 9h instead of 8h, and 2) because of other deadlines, I could only afford to work 6h30 on SDP this week.

I still could PR'ed all my work as my biggest task could easily be split into two subtasks (UI, xml, layout vs feature, database, Kotlin) and the 2 others are done.

## Sophie
My task this week was to complete the sorting and filtering mechanism and ui for the books, which I did five hours (so for a total of approximately 12 hours, if it is added to the work of last week). However, to have a good way to test the database, the same mechanism was needed for the sales, which also took me approximately five hours. I thus didn't have the time to implement the tests for my implementation, and I didn't do a pull request for my work.

I am encountering an issue that we are trying to solve with the team : when the filtering parameters are set and the `Result` button is pressed, we need to launch the activity to actually list the books/sales. The fact of adding an extra parameter (the Query) makes the program crash.

For next week, I need to 1. Fix this issue 2. implement the tests for the two activities (Books and Sales filtering) if I have the time, I will help Joshua with his own tests

## Zied

This week was all about fixing all the warnings generated in some xml activites and writing some tests to make sure that the google authentification doesn't generate any errors or exceptions. I also started the creation of the user profile but didn't have time to finish it. I only worked 6 hours instead of 8 hours this week due to some projects deadlines in other courses.

Next week I will be able to work the full 8 hours on the user profile.

## Overall team

This week was rough with several people encountering roadblocks, but interactions in the team remain good. Several PR that are in the works should be able to get finished up. get finished up
Next week I hope we can resolve these test issues that can end up being a real dealbreaker for the app.
