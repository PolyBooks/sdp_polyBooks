## Dario (Scrum Master)

This week unfortunately I lost a big part of my work on registration/login by email/password because of a git stash that didn't go well. So I had to work on it again and now it's done. I also worked on my task of this week with Joshua by starting to implement the GPS feature on the app.
Next time, I know how to never lose my work.
