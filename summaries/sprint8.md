# Summary for week 8

## Dario (Scrum Master)


## Joshua
This week I did some refactoring and started on the gps, and had to go through a lot of documentation to be able to do so.  
This made me discover the backend a bit more which was interesting.
Next time I hope to be able to continue working with someone as a pair.

## Nicolas

This week (last sprint) I split my tasks into smaller chunks. It was successful. I managed to close 4 out of 5 tasks: I finished the sale information display (2 tasks related), design the bare bones of an interface able to store/retrieve images to/from a db, and refactored the project to follow our coding guidelines


## Raoul
I had deadlines for other courses on both Monday and Wednesday, so I could only start working Thursday. I managed to cram the whole 8 hours in a single day, but it was not necessarily pleasant, nor was I at peak productivity towards the end.

Next week, I will split up the work more evenly across the week, and it should not be too hard as I will only have a single deadline, and I used to be able to do it before this week.


## Sophie
This week I managed to complete all my tasks. I was able to finish the testing of `FilteringSalesActivity`, and make `FilteringBooksActivity` dynamic as well. So to be clear, now both the two filtering activities are in a finished version : we can properly filter the books and the sales with parameter values that really exist in the database.

Next week I will work on various minor fixes in the database, because some query requests are not implemented yet. 

## Zied

This week unfortunately I lost a big part of my work on registration/login by email/password because of a git stash that didn't go well. So I had to work on it again and now it's done. I also worked on my task of this week with Joshua by starting to implement the GPS feature on the app.
Next time, I know how to never lose my work.
