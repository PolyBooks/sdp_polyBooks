# Summary for week 8

## Dario (Scrum Master)


## Joshua
This week I did some refactoring and started on the gps, and had to go through a lot of documentation to be able to do so.  
This made me discover the backend a bit more which was interesting.
Next time I hope to be able to continue working with someone as a pair.

This week unfortunately I lost a big part of my work on registration/login by email/password because of a git stash that didn't go well. So I had to work on it again and now it's done. I also worked on my task of this week with Joshua by starting to implement the GPS feature on the app.
Next time, I know how to never lose my work.
