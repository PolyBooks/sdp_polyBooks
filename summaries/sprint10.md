# Summary for week 10

## Dario
This week set up the project to use mock firebase instances for tests. I then did some refactoring, removing unused code. I did stuff that had to be done so I believe it was a good week. Next week I will probably work more with the other team members to be closer to finishing the very important features

This week I didn't have the time to do anything, I am caught up with other projects. My apologies to the team and our coachs :(

## Overall team
We did our two weekly meetings as usual, we are approaching the end of the semester and mostly talked about what needs to be finalized absolutely. We are not planning to do any new tasks.
