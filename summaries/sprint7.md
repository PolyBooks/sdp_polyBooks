# Summary for week 7

## Dario  
This week I greatly advanced the Firebase Book database, and I was able to merge it with main. I also did a refactoring of Sale, which was intended to be relatively small, but which turned out to be major. I did my hours of work and was productive I feel, so that was good.

This week I was able to completely implement the navigation bar and incorporate it into all pre-existing activities. I was able to see the progress we made since the beginning since I revisited a lot of old work.

Next week I hope I'll be able to work on something new

This week I finished the registration by email and password and I have done some tests to be sure that it is working correctly. I have also done some changes and improvements for the User profile. Everything went well, no major bugs or waste of time. I hope next week will be the same for my new tasks.
